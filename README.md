# Calculating-Copper
## ExploreSA Gawler Challenge
The Calculating Copper submission is an interactive and reproducible workflow for creating mineral prediction maps using machine learning. The workflow is completely open source and is aimed for people who are interested in gaining a better understanding of the uses of artificial intelligence in mineral exploration. 
In particular, Calculating Copper uses regional drilling results, geophysical and geological data over the entire Gawler Craton to predict areas of base metal mineralization (Cu, Zn, Pb, Au) using a mineral systems approach. The submission is split into 6 interactive jupyter notebooks.

#### GEOLOGY FOREVER – Understanding the geological history

#### HAIR AND MAKEUP – Defining target variable and features

#### SUIT UP – Compiling data table and exploratory data analysis

#### MY FRIEND ROBOT – Machine learning model comparison

#### GOLD RUSH – Validating models against existing mines

#### EXTRA EXTRA – Compositional data analysis on calcrete survey
