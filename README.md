# Calculating-Copper
The Calculating Copper submission is an interactive and reproducible workflow for creating mineral prediction maps using machine learning. The workflow is completely open source and is aimed for people who are interested in gaining a better understanding of the uses of artificial intelligence in mineral exploration. 
In particular, Calculating Copper uses regional drilling results, geophysical and geological data over the entire Gawler Craton to predict areas of base metal mineralization (Cu, Zn, Pb, Au) using a mineral systems approach. The submission is split into 6 interactive jupyter notebooks.

The associated data and notebooks can be found at [this Google Drive location](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1cLEcWeQccVmht73xsf-4RUZSHPPnfICw?usp=sharing).
